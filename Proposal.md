Target audience: People considering moving into a new city.

Safety is one of the most significant factors that affect people's decisions on where to live. Everyone wants to live in a peaceful city, but usually, it is not easy to make the right choice. Searching over the Internet for crime-related news that happened within a specific location is often very time-consuming, Our app will show the distribution of serious violent crime cases that happened in 68 U.S. police jurisdictions and also the changes in the number of crimes over recent 40 years in each of these 68 U.S. police jurisdictions.

# Description of the data

We will be visualizing the dataset of serious violent crime cases that happened in 68 U.S. police jurisdictions over 40 years. This [city crime dataset](https://github.com/themarshallproject/city-crime) is contributed by Gabriel Dance, Tom Meagher, and Emily Hopkins from the Marshall Project. It contains 2829 entries. Each of the entries denotes a report of crimes that happened in a specific location in a specific year. 

The column `ORI` is an identifier for each police jurisdiction and the column `department_name` is the name of the department. The column `total_pop` represents the number of residents living under the specific police jurisdiction. 

The dataset includes information about four types of major violent crimes: homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Column `violent_crime` is the total number of violent crimes that happened and  `homs_sum`, `rape_sum`, `rob_sum` and `agg_ass_sum` are the number of crime cases of each of the categories respectively. Column `violent_per_100k` is the average number of violent crimes within every 100 thousand residents in that city.
